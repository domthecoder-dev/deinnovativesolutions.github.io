      question: "Do I own the website once it's completed?",
      answer: "Absolutely! Once your website is finalised and you have given your approval, it is entirely yours. You are investing in a custom-built digital asset for your business or personal use, and full ownership is transferred to you upon completion.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will my website be mobile-friendly?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely! In today's digital landscape, having a website that looks and functions flawlessly on all devices – from desktops to tablets and smartphones – is crucial. Whether we are crafting your site with custom code or utilising platforms like WordPress or Wix, we ensure a fully responsive design that provides an optimal viewing experience for all your visitors.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you help with things like SEO (Search Engine Optimization) or website hosting (beyond the initial Xneelo setup)?",
      answer: "Yes, we can definitely help you optimize your website for search engines! We employ effective strategies to identify relevant keywords and structure your site to improve its visibility in search results. Regarding hosting, while we recommend Xneelo for its user-friendliness, we can certainly work with you if you have already secured hosting with another provider. Please let us know your setup when you request a quote.",
    },
    {
      question: "How can I contact you if I have more questions?",
      answer: "We are always happy to answer your questions! You can easily reach out to us through our <a href=\"../HTML/Quote.html\">Request a Quote Form</a>. We will get back to you promptly via WhatsApp or email with the information you need.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you only build websites using hardcoding, or do you work with platforms like WordPress for new projects?",
      answer: "While we often prefer the flexibility and complete customisation that comes with hardcoding websites for new projects, allowing for truly unique and tailored designs without platform limitations, we also recognize the benefits of platforms like WordPress, especially for certain types of websites or when requested by the client. We will discuss the best approach for your specific needs during our consultation.",

    },
    {
      question: "Why do I need to set up an account with Xneelo.com?",
      answer: "For clients who do not yet have hosting, we highly recommend Xneelo. They offer competitive pricing and a user-friendly platform that simplifies domain management, WordPress installation, and email setup – making it easy for both of us to manage your website effectively. However, if you already have a hosting account with another provider, we are happy to work with your existing setup.",
    },
    {
      question: "What information will I need to provide to get started?",
      answer: "To give you the most accurate quote, please provide as much detail as possible about your desired website – including the type of site, any specific features you need, and if you have examples of websites you like, please share the links! Once the invoice is paid, we will guide you through the simple process of setting up your Xneelo hosting account (if needed). After that, we will require the login details to begin development. If we need any further information, we will be sure to reach out.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens after I provide the login details?",
      answer: "Once we receive your login details, our development process kicks into gear! Whether we are building your site with custom code or using WordPress, we will start bringing your vision to life. Once the initial development is complete, we will present it to you for review and feedback. We include up to three rounds of significant revisions to ensure you are completely satisfied. Any changes beyond that will be assessed based on the additional time and effort required.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the website design and development process typically take?",
      answer: "The timeline for website development varies depending on the complexity and scope of your project. While we often aim to deliver websites within approximately 7 business days, this is an estimate. We will provide a more specific timeline tailored to your project after we have discussed your needs in detail during the quote process.",
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of support do you offer after the website is launched?",
      answer: "Once your website is launched and you have given your final approval, we consider the initial project complete. We include up to three rounds of significant revisions during the development phase to ensure your satisfaction. If you are interested in ongoing support such as monthly or yearly website maintenance or SEO optimization services, please let us know when you request your quote, and we will be happy to provide you with pricing options.",
